# Chat GPT 3.5 Games
This was a test using Chat GPT 3.5 to see how many successfully working games could be made with minimal extra effort to make them work.  
Also using Blazor Webassembly as the technology.

I spent about 5 hours making these games as well as a few that had to be abandoned due to Chat GPT not giving a complete solution or mixed solutions I couldn't get to work without major overhaul.  

It would be interesting to do this activity again agains the new AI.
